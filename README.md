# Python-Project

# Introduction of hangman:
Hangman is a word game in which the player is trying to guess a secret word. The player guesses letters, one at a time, and is told where each such letter appears in the secret word. If a guessed letter does not appear at all, it is considered a mistake.


# Benefit of hangman game:
Hangman game offers a challenge that will motivate the students to try to guess word based on the theme. It is an excellent way to practice spelling, increase vocabulary, and keep the mind focus on teaching learning process.


# Summary
The Hangman Game In Python project requires good knowledge of Python which includes defining functions and managing for/while loops. The functions that we use here contain arguments that are defined in a global scope which can be further used in other functions to improve game quality. It can also be used to provide different steps when required to execute upon conditions by the for and while loops.
